🚀 Quick Start (Local Development)
Follow these steps to get the project running on your local machine.

Prerequisites
Node.js (LTS recommended)

MongoDB Atlas Account

Groq API Key

1. Clone the Repository
Bash

git clone YOUR_GITHUB_REPO_URL edumentor-ai
cd edumentor-ai
2. Configure Environment Variables
Create two separate .env files:

A. Backend (/server/.env)
Create this file in the server directory.

Plaintext

# Server Configuration
PORT=5000
NODE_ENV=development

# Database
MONGO_URI=mongodb+srv://<USER>:<PASS>@<CLUSTER>.mongodb.net/ai-tutor

# Security
JWT_SECRET=your_super_secret_jwt_key
JWT_EXPIRE=30d

# AI Service
GROQ_API_KEY=gsk_your_groq_api_key
GROQ_MODEL=llama-3.3-70b-versatile
B. Frontend (/client/.env)
Create this file in the client directory.

Plaintext

# Frontend Configuration
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:5000/api
3. Install Dependencies
Install dependencies for both the backend and frontend separately:

Bash

# Backend Setup
cd server
npm install

# Frontend Setup
cd ../client
npm install
4. Run the Application
Run both the server and the client in separate terminal tabs:

Tab 1: Start Backend

Bash

cd server
npm run dev 
# Server should log: Server running in development mode on port 5000
Tab 2: Start Frontend

Bash

cd client
npm run dev
# App should open in your browser at http://localhost:5173
🌐 Deployment (CI/CD)
The project is configured for a robust Split Deployment using GitHub Actions/Vercel/Render.

Component	Host	Root Directory	Environment Variables Needed
Frontend (React)	Vercel	client	VITE_API_URL (Set to Render URL + /api)
Backend (Node/Express)	Render	server	MONGO_URI, JWT_SECRET, GROQ_API_KEY, FRONTEND_URL (Set to Vercel URL)

💡 Roadmap (Future Features)
Progress Tracking: Implement the /progress page with charts/graphs showing user performance over time.

English Course: Expand content support beyond Mathematics.

Customization: Allow users to select preferred difficulty and learning style.
